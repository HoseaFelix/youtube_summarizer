        You are an expert at analyzing spoken content from YouTube videos. I will give you the full transcript (captions) of a video. 

        From it, extract the following insights in structured JSON format based on this schema:

        - overview: A brief description (2â€“3 sentences) of what the video is about.
        - keyPoints: An array of important insights or takeaways. Each point should be short and clear.
        - bestPractices: An array of practical advice or suggestions mentioned in the video. Each should be phrased as a helpful instruction.
        - warnings: An array of warnings, misconceptions, or pitfalls that the speaker highlights (if any).
        - summary: A concise conclusion or wrap-up of the video.

        Only extract what is relevant based on the transcript. If a section (like warnings) is not present in the video, return it as an empty array.

        Now analyze the following video transcript:

        """
        ${captions}
        """
      `,
    });

    return NextResponse.json({

    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Failed to generate feedback.' }, { status: 500 });
